# EX-11-EMI-CALCULATOR

## AIM

To write a program to prepare EMI calculator using function without return type and with arguments.

## ALGORITHM

1.	Start the program.
2.	Read principal amount, rate of interest and months.
3.	Pass these values as arguments to function.
4.	Calculate EMI using the formula, amt=(prpow(1+r,t))/(pow(1+r,t)-1)
5.	Display the result.
6.	Stop the program.

# EX -15 - Replace All Even Elements With 'E' In One Dimensional Array

## Aim:
To write a C program to replace all even elements with 'E' in one dimensional array

## Algorithm:
1.	Input the array:
  Read the size of the array.
  Input the elements of the array.
2.	Iterate through the array:
 	For each element of the array, check if the element is even (i.e., if the element modulo 2 equals 0).
3.	Replace even elements with 'E':
     If an element is even, replace that element with the character 'E'.
4.	Output the updated array:
 Print the updated array after replacements.

## Program:
